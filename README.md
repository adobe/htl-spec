HTML Template Language Specification
====
The [HTML Template Language](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-htl/content/overview.html "HTL Guide") (HTL), formerly known as Sightly, has been introduced with [Adobe Experience Manager](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management.html) 6.0 and takes the place of JSP (JavaServer Pages) as the preferred and recommended server-side template system for HTML.

This is the [HTL Specification](https://github.com/adobe/htl-spec/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md) that defines the syntax and the behavior of the language.

A Java-based reference implementation has been [donated to the Apache Sling project](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3959) and can be checked out from https://github.com/apache/sling/tree/trunk/bundles/scripting/sightly.

The [Technology Compatibility Kit](https://github.com/adobe/htl-tck) can be run on implementations to check their compliance with the specification.

An implementation of [version 1.4](https://github.com/adobe/htl-spec/blob/1.4/SPECIFICATION.md) of the language specification is available in AEM 6.3 SP3 and AEM 6.4 SP1.
